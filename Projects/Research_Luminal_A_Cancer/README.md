## Luminal A Cancer

Taking part in a university research project, this projects is efficiently trying to find the best way to select the top 100 predictive genes for Luminal A cancer, from a pool of around 30,000. The approach taken is a greedy Forward Selection method. The Forward Selection method trains a Logistic Regression model and in each iteration selects the gene (feature) with the highest accuracy.
